# ALIZA SHOPPING WEBSITE 
### *UNDER PROCESS*
I am planning on using Figma, Supabase and whatever tool is needed to create this website.

The website would be made from *Next.js + Vercel + Stripe + MongoDB (Intermediate/Pro)*
I do not have experience in these languages, so, it might take a while to finsih it T_T
